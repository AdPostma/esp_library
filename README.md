> curated audio datasets for animal research

* [zebra_finch](https://github.com/earthspecies/esp_library/tree/master/zebra_finch) - 3405 zebra finch calls classified across 11 call types. Additonal labels include name of individual making the vocalization and its age (chick or adult).
* [macaques](https://github.com/earthspecies/esp_library/tree/master/macaques) - 7285 macaque coo calls from 8 individuals (4 males and 4 females)
* [giant otter](https://github.com/earthspecies/library/tree/master/giant_otter) - A tutorial demonstrating a complete ML pipeline applied to giant otter bioacoustics, beginning with data preprocessing, proceeding to load the data, and culminating in the construction and training of a CNN-based classifier capable of labeling giant otter vocalizations according to call type.

All datasets are accessible by issuing a single command from within the [fastai v2 library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai2).
